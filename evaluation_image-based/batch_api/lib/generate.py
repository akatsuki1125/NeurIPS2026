_CRITERIA_BODY = r"""
Evaluate based on the three criteria below and return ONLY a JSON object with integer scores.

1. instruction_adherence (1-5)
   How well does the edited diagram satisfy the requested changes in the instructions?
   Focus on whether each requested change is correctly applied. Do not penalize for unintended changes in this criterion.
   Note: In this criterion, evaluate only whether the requested changes are correctly applied. Do not consider any changes that were not specified in the instructions; those should be evaluated under 3. content_preservation.
   5 (Perfect): All requested changes are correctly applied according to the instructions.
   4 (Good): Most requested changes are correctly applied, with only minor omissions or inaccuracies.
   3 (Fair): Some requested changes are correctly applied, but several important ones are missing or inaccurate.
   2 (Poor): Only a few requested changes are correctly applied, and many are missing or inaccurate.
   1 (Very Poor): Few or none of the requested changes are correctly applied.

2. diagram_readability (1-5)
   How easy is it to clearly see and understand the elements in the edited diagram?
   Focus only on visibility and legibility. Ignore whether the edits follow the instructions.
   Note: In this criterion, carefully check readability details as well, including any small cut-offs, overlaps, occlusions, or other visibility issues.
   5 (Perfect): All elements are clearly visible and easy to read, with no overlaps, occlusions, elements cut off, or size issues.
   4 (Good): Most elements are clearly visible, with only minor issues such as slight overlap, small elements, or elements partially cut off that do not affect overall readability.
   3 (Fair): Some elements are difficult to see, and this noticeably affects readability, but the diagram is still understandable overall.
   2 (Poor): Many elements are hard to see due to overlap, occlusion, small size, or being cut off, making the diagram difficult to interpret.
   1 (Very Poor): The diagram is largely unreadable, with severe visibility issues such as extensive overlap, occlusion, or elements being cut off.

3. content_preservation (1-5)
   To what extent does the edited diagram avoid unintended changes?
   Focus only on changes that were not requested. Do not consider whether the requested changes are correct.
   Evaluate any changes not specified in the instructions, including major layout modifications. Check carefully for subtle or minor unintended changes.
   5 (Perfect): No unintended changes are present; all non-requested parts of the diagram remain unchanged.
   4 (Good): Very few unintended changes are present, and they have minimal impact on the overall diagram.
   3 (Fair): Some unintended changes are present and somewhat affect the diagram.
   2 (Poor): Many unintended changes are introduced, affecting large parts of the diagram.
   1 (Very Poor): Extensive unintended changes are present, and much of the original content is not preserved.

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no explanation):

_IMPORTANT_NOTES = r"""
Important Notes for Evaluation:
- Invalid Edited Output: If the edited output is not a diagram, please rate all three criteria as 1 (Very Poor). Examples include a completely blank (white) image and a text-only image.
- Whitespace/Margins: If the edited diagram is present but surrounded by whitespace or margins, ignore the whitespace and evaluate only the diagram content itself.
- Cropped or Cut-Off Diagrams: If the diagram appears cropped or cut off (missing elements at edges), evaluate this under the Diagram Readability criterion, as it directly affects visibility.
